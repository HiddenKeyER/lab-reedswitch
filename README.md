# Reed switch lab

This lab shows how to use two reed switches wired to an Arduino board to control the brightness of an LED. The reed switches are separated by a known distance, which combined with the closing time of each switch, is used by Arduino to calculate the speed of the magnetic volume. Finally, Arduino uses it to set the brightness of the LED at the precise moment.
